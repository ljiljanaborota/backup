logical operators
allow us to combine multiple conditions. work only with boolean value(true,false).
there are 3 log.operatores..
first is NOT !  . second is AND  ||  , thirt one is &&
we used them
1.they can simplify the logic,its shorter way with them.
2.we used them to do code faster,its reduce the lines of code that we have to write
NOT operator !
its reversed the conditions..if something is true,with this operator in front we will make it false,or false to true
for examlple
System.out.println(!true);  will print false
OR operator ||
if i have 2 or more  conditions,its combines them and returned true as long as there is one condition is true.if all the conditions
become false it returnes to false. if there True is always True
if you by mistake put small letter we can do equals Ignore case, and will ignore mistake with lower letter
AND &&
it can also combine more conditions.it only returns true id all the conditions are true
