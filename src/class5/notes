Logical Operators
Just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean values.
there are Logical operators  !  ||  &&
1 operator NOT (!)
not is used to change condicions..where ever we put that sign,its change conditions from false to true and reverse
2.operator || OR
 its means that if there is one true,than its true..one needs to be true
3.operator && AND
 it means both values are true
 SWITCH CASE
 statement are other way of achiving same as IF ELSE if condition.
 we used them because is faster way..
