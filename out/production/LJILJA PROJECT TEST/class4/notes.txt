Operators :
Operators are different symbols that we used to perform operations like additions,-,/,*
to compare if the numbers are greater or not <  >
there are three main types od operators. Arithmetic operators, Relational operators, and logical operators.
Arithmetical operators:
We used them to perform simple Math operations
- addition
+ subtraction
/  division
*  multiplication
%  modulus or (when we are dividing something,left over is modulus-reminder)

Relational operators:
Are used to compare two quantities or entities,or if something is bigger than other think, or  if two numbers are same
or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not

== we used to check if two variables are equal or contain same value or not.
if they contain we get true,if not we get false as answer in console
!= we used to check if two variables not contain the same value. we get true if they are not same
>  used to check if one value s greater than other value..if is greater we get true
<  used to check if one value is smaller than other value left side smaller of the right side..if is,we get true
>=  if the value on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are same,we will get a true.
<= if the value on the left is smaller than value on right side,or if they are same,we will get a true.
Conditional constructions
Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition is true that Java execute the code
otherwise it skips code.
How to write If-else conditions:
if(condition){
any line of code even another if condition
if(){
}
Imortants notes:
for String we use equals method instead of === sign because it is a non primitive data type
we can cmd=opt=l for mac or ctrl=alt=l for windows to format our code
if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part

if else conditions
when we have to test the same variable for multiple conditions i should use IF ELSE IF
when we have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other i should use NESTED IF
